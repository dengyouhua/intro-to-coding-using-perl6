Title: Introduction to Computer Programming

Instructor: Tom Browder

Sessions: Three two-hour classes

This short course will introduce you to computer programming ("coding")
using the GNU/Linux operating system.  Using your laptop (or one
of the college's Windows PCs) you will boot into a Debian 9 GNU/Linux
system and learn the rudiments of command-line execution of
various utility programs and special purpose tools like 'ls', 'grep',
'file', etc. Using a text editor such as 'gedit' or 'vi' you will
learn how to write the classic "Hello, World!" program in several
programming languages including C, Python, Ruby, bash, PostScript,
and Perl 6. Then you will continue to use the Perl 6 language
and learn how to write programs that manipulate data in various
ways.
