Title: Introduction to Computer Programming

Instructor: Tom Browder

Sessions: Three two-hour classes

Would you like to become familiar with "coding" to see what your
children or grandchildren may be learning in school? Want to
learn some computer skills used by Google engineers?

This short course will introduce you to computer programming ("coding")
using the GNU/Linux operating system (OS), the OS used on
most supercomputers.  Using your laptop (or one
of the college's Windows PCs) you will boot into a Debian 9 GNU/Linux
system and learn the rudiments of command-line execution of
various utility programs and special purpose tools like 'ls', 'grep',
'file', etc. Using a text editor, such as 'gedit' or 'vi', you will
learn how to write the classic "Hello, World!" program in several
programming languages including C, Python, Ruby, Bash, PostScript,
and Perl 6. Then you will continue to use the Perl 6 language
and learn how to write programs that manipulate files and data in various
ways. Finally, you will be introduced to local resources to
help you if you want to continue to pursue your newly-found interests.
No programming experience is required, but bringing a laptop to
class is recommended (the newer the better).
